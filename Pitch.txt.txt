Game Programming

Short Description:
The game that I had in mind is a pretty simple game. The player (A snake) will have an objective to cross a street with multiple lanes while avoiding the vehicules.
Randomly, on each lane, a vehicule will spawn moving on a straight line from one side of the screen, to the other.
The player will start with 3 lives and will lose one when they touch a vehicule. 
Everytime they lose a life, they will go back to spawn and start over. 

Characters and goals:

Snake: The snake is what the player will control. He will be able to move up, down, left and right depending on the keys pressed down. 
The objective of the snake is to successfully get to the other side of the street while evading the vehicules passing by.

Vihecules: The vihecules will be NPCs. They will spawn randomly on one side of the screen and move is a straight line to the other side. 
When they reach the other side, the will disappear. 
The goal of the vehicules is to run over the snake and prevent it from reaching the other side.

Win Conditions: 
To win the game, the player must successfully reach the other side of the street with at least one life left.

Lose Conditions:
The moment the player reaches zero lives, they lose the game.

Progression of levels:
I want there to be three levels in total. With it getting increasingly difficult the higher you are. 
The higher the level, the faster the vehicules will move and more lanes will be on the street.

Source of inspiration: 
For my source of inspiration, it is a game called "crossy road". It a mobile game that I use to play when I was younger with the same concept of this project.
I wanted to make a game that was not to complicated with the knowledge I have now.

Skills/ Interests in a teammate:
People who already knows the game 'crossy road'.
People with good communication skills and creativity. 
It would also be nice if they were good at coding and hard working.
